Humans communicate to each other through signals â€”purple robes for royalty, eye contact to show attention, and expensive cars to show wealth.

What else could we signal? What are reliable signals? How can a future social network respect users data ownership and enable privacy controls?

This is a project aimed at exploring augmented signals, eventually in AR, envisioning a virtual layer of signals on the phyiscal one. 
 
Current mobile version:
 - Flutter for use on both iOS and Android
 - Firebase backend
 - Signals based on location, privacy options to be open to everyone nearby, close friends nearby, and closed (dropped from the database).
